The city is burning down!
We need to put out these fires!
We are the first to respond, so it's going to be a mess!
Fire needs 3 main things to thrive: heat, oxygen, and fuel.
We can put out the fire by reducing the temperature!
The water takes the heat from the fire when it evaporates!
Let's try to put out as much as we can!
Other ways of putting out fires can include smothering them with dirt, chemicals, or some other blanketing material!
Right now, water is the most practical method!
Be sure to aim for the base of the fires!\nThis cools the source of the fire!
The heat from a fire is hot enough to kill!
Fire can scorch your lungs and melt clothes & other materials!
Fires can burn anywhere from around 300, 1000, and well over 2000 degrees Celsius!
While the heat from the flames can cause much damage, smoke inhalation causes more deaths!
Don't fly too close to the flames!
An average of over 60 firefighters die in the line of duty!
Make sure you aren't the next one!
Fire damage is responsible for billions of dollars in damage each year!
Let's get these fires extinguished!
Under normal conditions, a house fire can double in size every minute!
It's a good thing that it's not too windy today!
The more oxygen there is, the hotter the fires will burn!
Additionally, the wind could pose a problem for us in the air!
Also, the amount of oxygen can change the color of the flames!
Lesser flames burn yellow, but the hotter flames burn a shade a blue!
Try not to waste the water supply!\nWe need to put out as much as we can!
Fires are responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries every year!
The work we are doing out here is saving lives!
It only takes 30 seconds for a fire to become uncontrollable!
If we don't get these fires out soon, things will get out of control!
Large fires can spread at high speeds, such as 15 miles per hour!
Let's keep these fires from spreading anymore!
